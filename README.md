# SES_AVR_Project

## General Description:

This project was part of the Software for Embedded Systems (SES) course which was offered in Summer Semester 19/20 in the Mechatronics masters curriculum. This Project was an excellent way for me to learn about most of the Embedded Systems basics. Moreover, due this project my knowlege in C Programming have been furthered in addition to that it gave me a good background about AVR microcontrollers hardware especially the AVR (ATmega128RFA1). For each task there will be a specific readme file which includes the purpose of the corresponding task. 

## Important Notes:
- In all of the tasks there is a src file which contains the main.c file for each task.
- All code files (.h or .c) are well documented with in-line comments and Docstrings.
- The final version of the libraries is in the library SES_AVR_Project/ses_project/lib/ folder

## Credits: 
I would like to thank my friend and project partner George Mohsen for the great help he offered along the whole project.
